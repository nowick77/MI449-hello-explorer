        Moon
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and our closest celestial neighbor. Its gray, cratered surface tells the story of billions of years of asteroid and meteor impacts, frozen in time due to the absence of atmosphere and geological activity. The Moon's gravitational pull creates our ocean tides and has gradually slowed Earth's rotation over time. Despite appearing bright in our night sky, the Moon produces no light of its own—it simply reflects sunlight. Its phases, caused by the changing angles between the Sun, Earth, and Moon, have guided human timekeeping and navigation throughout history.
